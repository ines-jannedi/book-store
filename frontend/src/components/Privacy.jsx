                        <h3>User Content and Messages</h3>
                        <p>The Service allows you to post User Content, as defined in our Terms of Use.
                             Any User Content you post becomes available to the public via the Service.
                              User Content includes, but is not limited to, reviews, comments, and visual content. 
                              If you remove User Content, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or 
                              if other users have copied or stored your User Content.

                            Goodreads takes reasonable measures to keep messages that you send to other Members 
                            through the Service private between you and the recipient.
                             However, even if you have deleted the message from your Goodreads inbox or outbox,
                              copies of the message may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or 
                              if other users have copied or stored the message.</p>

                        <h3>Privacy Settings</h3>

                        <p>Your name is used when you invite another person to join Goodreads, 
                            or when you request to add another member to your friends list.
                             To the extent that you do not wish to have your name shared in this manner,
                            you should not make use of these services.
                            You can modify, delete, 
                            and set your privacy setting for information you provide us
                             any time in the account settings section of Goodreads.com 
                            after you have signed in using your personal password.</p>
                        <h3>Your Choices About Your Information</h3>

                        <p>You may access or change your information and preferences at any time in the account settings section of Goodreads.com 
                            once you have signed in with your personal password. For example, you can control which actions,
                             if any, will appear on your update feed, whether to display your e-mail address, 
                             whether to display your last name,
                             and what sort of e-mail notifications you will receive from the Service.
                             In addition, to the extent required by applicable law,
                              you may have the right to request access to or delete your personal information. 
                             To do so, you may visit here and navigate to the “Settings” tab or contact us. You may, of course,
                              decline to submit personally identifiable information through Goodreads,
                              in which case Goodreads may not be able to provide certain services to you.</p>

                        <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
                        <p>Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. 
                            For that reason, Goodreads does not knowingly collect or
                             solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. 
                            If you are under 13, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name,
                             address, telephone number, or e-mail address.
                             No one under age 13 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Goodreads. 
                             In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information 
                             from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent,
                              we will delete that information as quickly as possible</p>
